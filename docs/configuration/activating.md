# Activating the extension

There are a few steps that needs to be done after installing Acceptance Criterias. Most of the features in this extension is hidden behind feature toggles. This is done to prevent a lot of noise in organizations with a lot of projects. This way each individual project can decide if they wish to activate the extension.

## Activating the work hub

To activate the work hub that gives an overview over all criteiras, follow these steps:

## Adding the control to work items

The work item control can be added in two different ways. Either as a global work item page, or added to individual work item types.

### Activate for all work item types

This option will add the acceptance criteria page to all work item types in the project and is the quickest way to get up and running.

NOTE: You can hide the page on the work item types where you do not wish to use it, but this requires updating each work item type.

### Add to a single work item type

The acceptance criteria control is also available as a Custom Work Item Control and can be added to individual work item types.
